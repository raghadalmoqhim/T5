The goal is to go through the entire workflow from loading the data to evaluating the model and making predictions. Follow each step carefully. The dataset is stored in you can access it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khaledzsa/traffic-dataset), the target is to predict `traffic_volume` column. There is also command to download the dataset below.\n","\n","## Dataset: Traffic Dataset\n","\n","### Dataset Overview:\n","\n","- **Name**: Traffic Dataset\n","- **Description**: This dataset contains hourly data on the traffic volume for westbound I-94, a major interstate highway in the US that connects Minneapolis and St Paul, Minnesota. The data was collected by the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) from 2012 to 2018 at a station roughly midway between the two cities.\n","- **Time Period**: Starting from 18-11-2016\n","- **Frequency**: Hourly observations\n","\n","### Features:\n","\n","1. **temp:** a numeric variable that shows the average temperature in kelvin.\n","2. **rain_1h:** a numeric variable that shows the amount of rain in mm that occurred in the hour.\n","3. **snow_1h:** a numeric variable that shows the amount of snow in mm that occurred in the hour.\n","4. **clouds_all:** a numeric variable that shows the percentage of cloud cover.\n","5. **weather_main:** a categorical variable that gives a short textual description of the current weather (such as Clear, Clouds, Rain, etc.).\n","6. **weather_description:** a categorical variable that gives a longer textual description of the current weather (such as light rain, overcast clouds, etc.).\n","7. **date_time:** a datetime variable that shows the hour of the data collected in local CST time.\n","8. **traffic_volume:** a numeric variable that shows the hourly I-94 reported westbound traffic volume.\n","\n","#### Feel free to add or rearrange steps as you see fit to optimize your workflow. One additional note: the model's performance doesn't need to be 100% accurate. Instead, focus on achieving the best possible results while balancing performance and generalization."]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\n","from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, GRU, Dropout, SimpleRNN\n","from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping\n","from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error\n","from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import timeseries_dataset_from_array"],"metadata":{"id":"eW09Gs-n8Hrb","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1724562583366,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":8575,"user":{"displayName":"Raghad Almoqhim","userId":"03745324941454214724"}}},"id":"eW09Gs-n8Hrb","execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"9d58f5eb","metadata":{"id":"9d58f5eb"},"source":["## Load the Data\n","\n","Load the time series dataset into a pandas DataFrame.\n","\n","**Instructions:**\n","- Use `pandas` to load your dataset.\n","- Display the first few rows to understand its structure.\n","- Make sure the datetime column is correctly parsed."]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Here is a helping code that will download and unzip the dataset for you.\n","# Once you download the dataset you may comment the code!\n","!kaggle datasets download -d khaledzsa/traffic-dataset\n","!unzip traffic-dataset.zip"],"metadata":{"id":"tJG6da7n3tYZ","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1724562549322,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":990,"user":{"displayName":"Raghad Almoqhim","userId":"03745324941454214724"}},"outputId":"2be00ff2-265c-4638-ea71-8a069da2a07e"},"id":"tJG6da7n3tYZ","execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Dataset URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khaledzsa/traffic-dataset\n","License(s): unknown\n","Downloading traffic-dataset.zip to /content\n","  0% 0.00/235k [00:00<?, ?B/s]\n","100% 235k/235k [00:00<00:00, 58.7MB/s]\n","Archive:  traffic-dataset.zip\n","  inflating: Traffic Data.csv        \n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"id":"aeb78ac1","metadata":{"id":"aeb78ac1","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1724562615537,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":332,"user":{"displayName":"Raghad Almoqhim","userId":"03745324941454214724"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["df = pd.read_csv('/content/Traffic Data.csv')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c3122466","metadata":{"id":"c3122466"},"source":["## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n","\n","Perform exploratory data analysis on the dataset.\n","\n","**Instructions:**\n","- Plot the time series data.\n","- Analyze trends, seasonality, and potential outliers.\n","- Plot boxplots or scatter plots to identify any outliers or anomalies in the data.\n","- Seasonal Decomposition: Use `seasonal_decompose` from the `statsmodels` library to break down the time series data into trend, seasonality, and residual components.
